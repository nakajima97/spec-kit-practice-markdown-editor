# Feature Specification: Markdown Editor

**Feature Branch**: `002-i-want-to`  
**Created**: 2025-09-20  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "I want to create a Markdown editor. There will be no login feature. When opening the root path, the editor should be available immediately. There will be no save feature."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ’ Extracted: Markdown editor, no authentication, immediate access, no persistence
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ’ Identify: single user, text editing, markdown rendering, stateless sessions
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ’ Marked ambiguities in requirements section
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ’ User journey: access ’ edit ’ preview cycle
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ’ Each requirement is testable and measurable
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
   ’ Document content entity (in-memory only)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ’ No implementation details included
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ¡ Quick Guidelines
-  Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- L Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- =e Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a user, I want to immediately start editing markdown content when I visit the website, see a live preview of the formatted output, and use the editor without needing to sign up or save my work.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** I navigate to the root URL, **When** the page loads, **Then** I see an empty markdown editor ready for input
2. **Given** I type markdown syntax in the editor, **When** I enter content, **Then** I see a real-time preview of the formatted output
3. **Given** I am editing content, **When** I refresh the page, **Then** I start with a clean editor (no persistence expected)
4. **Given** I close the browser tab, **When** I return later, **Then** my previous content is not saved (stateless behavior)

### Edge Cases
- What happens when I paste very large amounts of text?
- How does the system handle invalid markdown syntax?
- What occurs if I try to input special characters or unicode content?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST display a markdown editor interface immediately upon accessing the root path
- **FR-002**: System MUST provide real-time preview of markdown content as the user types
- **FR-003**: System MUST render standard markdown syntax (headers, lists, links, emphasis, code blocks)
- **FR-004**: System MUST handle user input without requiring authentication or registration
- **FR-005**: System MUST operate without any save or persistence functionality
- **FR-006**: System MUST provide a clear separation between editing area and preview area
- **FR-007**: System MUST handle empty content gracefully (show empty editor and empty preview)
- **FR-008**: System MUST support [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific markdown flavor - CommonMark, GitHub Flavored Markdown, or other?]
- **FR-009**: System MUST handle [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: maximum content length not specified]
- **FR-010**: System MUST provide [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: accessibility features not specified - keyboard navigation, screen reader support?]

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Document Content**: Represents the markdown text being edited, exists only in browser memory during the session, no persistence across sessions
