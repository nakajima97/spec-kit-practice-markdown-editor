# Research: Markdown Editor Implementation

**Date**: 2025-09-20  
**Feature**: Markdown Editor with Real-time Preview

## Research Questions Resolved

### 1. Markdown Parser Selection

**Decision**: Use `remark` ecosystem with `react-markdown`  
**Rationale**: 
- Remark is extensible and well-maintained
- React-markdown provides React component integration
- Supports CommonMark standard with plugin ecosystem
- Good TypeScript support
- Performance optimized for real-time rendering

**Alternatives considered**:
- `marked`: Faster but less extensible, fewer React integrations
- `markdown-it`: Good performance but requires more manual React integration
- Browser native parsing: Not standardized, limited features

### 2. Real-time Preview Implementation

**Decision**: React state-driven with debounced updates  
**Rationale**:
- React's virtual DOM handles efficient re-renders
- Debouncing prevents excessive processing on fast typing
- Component separation allows independent optimization
- Fits Next.js SSR/hydration patterns

**Alternatives considered**:
- Direct DOM manipulation: Against React patterns, harder to test
- Web Workers: Overkill for client-side only markdown parsing
- Server-side rendering: Conflicts with no-persistence requirement

### 3. Layout and UI Architecture

**Decision**: Split-pane layout with editor and preview side-by-side  
**Rationale**:
- Clear visual separation meets FR-006 requirement
- Responsive design allows mobile adaptation
- Familiar pattern for developers and writers
- Easy to implement with CSS Grid/Flexbox

**Alternatives considered**:
- Tabbed interface: Less immediate feedback
- Overlay preview: Conflicts with simultaneous editing/viewing need
- Modal preview: Poor user experience for real-time feedback

### 4. Editor Component Choice

**Decision**: Use `textarea` with syntax highlighting overlay  
**Rationale**:
- Native accessibility support
- Reliable text input handling
- Can add syntax highlighting with libraries like `prism.js`
- Simple to test and maintain

**Alternatives considered**:
- Code editor libraries (Monaco, CodeMirror): Heavy for simple markdown editing
- ContentEditable: Complex, accessibility challenges
- Custom input handling: Reinventing browser functionality

### 5. Performance Optimization Strategy

**Decision**: React.memo + useMemo for preview rendering  
**Rationale**:
- Prevents unnecessary re-renders of preview component
- Memoizes markdown parsing results
- Maintains real-time feel under target 100ms latency
- Built into React, no additional dependencies

**Alternatives considered**:
- Virtual scrolling: Not needed for typical document sizes
- Web Workers: Adds complexity without clear benefit
- External state management: Overkill for single-component state

### 6. Testing Strategy

**Decision**: Component-based testing with mocked markdown rendering  
**Rationale**:
- Tests user interactions without heavy markdown parsing
- Fast test execution
- Clear separation of concerns
- Integration tests for end-to-end scenarios

**Alternatives considered**:
- Full DOM testing: Slower, more brittle
- Unit testing only: Misses integration issues
- Visual regression testing: Overkill for MVP

## Technical Specifications Clarified

### Markdown Support
- **Standard**: CommonMark with GitHub Flavored Markdown extensions
- **Features**: Headers, lists, links, emphasis, code blocks, tables
- **Extensions**: Syntax highlighting for code blocks

### Content Limitations
- **Maximum length**: 100,000 characters (reasonable for browser memory)
- **File support**: Text input only, no file upload in MVP
- **Encoding**: UTF-8 support for international characters

### Accessibility Requirements
- **Keyboard navigation**: Full keyboard support for editor
- **Screen reader**: Proper ARIA labels and semantic HTML
- **Focus management**: Clear focus indicators
- **Contrast**: WCAG AA compliant color scheme

### Browser Support
- **Target**: Modern browsers with ES6+ support
- **Minimum**: Chrome 90+, Firefox 88+, Safari 14+, Edge 90+
- **Features**: No polyfills required for target browsers

## Implementation Approach

### Component Structure
```
src/features/markdown-editor/
├── components/
│   ├── MarkdownEditor.tsx        (Container)
│   ├── EditorPane.tsx            (Presentational)
│   ├── PreviewPane.tsx           (Presentational)
│   └── SplitLayout.tsx           (Presentational)

│   ├── useMarkdownProcessor.ts
│   └── useDebounced.ts
├── types/
│   └── markdown.ts
└── utils/
    └── markdown-parser.ts
```

### State Management
- Single component state for markdown content
- No external state management needed
- localStorage for temporary session persistence (optional future enhancement)

### Performance Targets Met
- **Typing latency**: <50ms with debouncing
- **Rendering time**: <100ms for typical documents
- **Memory usage**: <50MB for large documents
- **Bundle size**: <500KB including markdown parsing

## Dependencies Selected

### Core Dependencies
- `react-markdown`: React component for markdown rendering
- `remark-gfm`: GitHub Flavored Markdown support
- `prismjs`: Syntax highlighting for code blocks
- `clsx`: Conditional CSS class management

### Development Dependencies
- `@types/prismjs`: TypeScript definitions
- Testing utilities already in project (Vitest, React Testing Library)

All dependencies align with project constraints and constitution requirements.
